# GymTrack

GymTrack is a minimal, focused workout-tracking application designed to capture routines, sets, and progress with an emphasis on speed and accessibility. Built with Rails 7 and the Hotwire stack (Turbo + Stimulus), it provides an app-like experience without a heavy client-side framework.

Features
- Create and manage workouts, exercises, and individual sets
- Fast client-server interactions using Turbo streams and Turbo Frames
- Small, focused Stimulus controllers for interactive UI bits (inline editing, timers, form enhancements)
- Mobile-first responsive layout and optimistic UI updates
- Video preview/demo included: `/gymtrack-preview.mp4`

Tech highlights
- Rails 7 for backend and conventions
- Turbo for near-instant navigation and partial updates
- Stimulus for lightweight JavaScript behavior

Notes
- The project prioritizes simplicity, reliability, and low-latency interactions rather than extensive single-page app complexity.
- Consider adding a demo account or seeded data for evaluation.
