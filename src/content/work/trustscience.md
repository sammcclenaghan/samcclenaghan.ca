At TrustScience I worked on a developer‑facing internal operations tool built with Vue.js, where I implemented client onboarding workflows and a JSON Patch–based file versioning system to improve reliability and efficiency. Over two summers I learned JavaScript, AWS Lambda, and DynamoDB, led migrations toward serverless and Elasticsearch, and improved test coverage with Playwright to deliver faster, more dependable client integrations.
