At Leanpub, I am working on porting a monolithic Rails application to a modern Rails backend with a Remix frontend communicating via GraphQL in preparation for Leanpub V3. I focus primarily on backend modernization, improving server-side logic and integrations to support the new architecture, and contributing to the book publishing pipeline to ensure reliable generation and delivery of published content.
